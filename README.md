# Readable

A browser extension that transforms cluttered web pages into clean, distraction-free reading experiences.

## Features

- **Content Extraction**: Uses Mozilla's Readability library to extract the main content from any web page
- **Clean Interface**: Presents articles in a beautiful, easy-to-read format
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to your browser's theme preference
- **Isolated Rendering**: Uses Shadow DOM to prevent style conflicts with the original page
- **One-Click Toggle**: Easily switch between the original page and readable view

## How It Works

Readable runs entirely in your browser. When activated:

1. It clones the current page
2. Extracts the meaningful content using Readability
3. Renders a clean version with React and Tailwind CSS
4. Isolates the new view using Shadow DOM technology

## Usage

1. Navigate to any article, blog post, or content-heavy page
2. Click the Readable extension icon in your browser toolbar
3. Enjoy the distraction-free reading experience
4. Click the Ã— button (or the extension icon again) to return to the original page
